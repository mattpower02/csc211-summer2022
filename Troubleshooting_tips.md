## Common Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Run early, run often**
    - Running your program in CS50 just a single time is not sufficient, especially when you’re trying to troubleshoot an issue
    - **GradeScope is not a debugger**. It's up to you to verify the correctness of your code as you go. 
    - You should only be submitting your code to GradeScope when you think you can pass the assignment 
    - Make sure that you’re checking the correctness of your program as you work on it, not just once at the end

2. Check your variable names 
    - Make sure that your naming conventions are consistent throughout your program
    - Meaningful variable names are extremely important
      - If you name your variables ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’, you’ll need to change them to something meaningful before asking for help 
    - Remember that you must identify the type of a variable as you define it 
  
3. Make sure that your functions make sense
    - All functions need a retutn type
      - additionally, all funtion paramaters will need their types defined 
    - As a general rule of thumb, keep your names consistent when passing variables between functions
    - Make sure that every function is being called somewhere
      - This somewhere doesn’t need to be in main 
    - Make sure that these function calls match what your function is actually taking in and returning
    - If your function is too long, consider breaking it into smaller parts
 
4. **When in doubt, print!**
    - Utilize print statements to check your work
    - If you expect a variable to be changed, use print statements to verify your logic 
    - If you’re not sure that an array index is being accessed or modified correctly, you can print out your entire array by using a for loop
    - Make sure to delete any prints you used for testing prior to submission!
      - If you ever see "expected one line, recieved two" in gradescope, it's because you have some extraneous print 

5. Testing your program 
    - Get in the habit of testing your program multiple times
    - Test different parts of your program rather than the whole thing once at the end
    - Verify what your program is saying by doing out calulations by hand
    - **if you're failing on a specfic case in gradescope, test using that exact case**

  
6. Common resources 
    - If you are found to be directly copying code from any of these resources you will will be prosecuted in accordance with the [University’s Policy of Academic Honesty](https://web.uri.edu/studentconduct/files/Student-Handbook-FINAL-08.22.2019.pdf)
